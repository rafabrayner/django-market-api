## About

This is a Django REST API for creating, updating, and deleting products from a market database

---


## How it works


### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org)

If you are using Unix System, you can install the Python 3.11 by:
```bash 
$ sudo apt update
# Install the Python 3.11
$ sudo apt install python3.11
```

With Python already installed, you will need to install the ```virtualenv``` python package.
You can install this with the following command:
```bash 
$ python3.11 -m pip install virtualenv
```

In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)


#### Install

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git@github.com:rafabrayner/django-market-api.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd django_market_api

# Install the virtual environment
$ python3.11 -m virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
$ . ./venv/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### How to use
```bash

# Go to the project root folder
$ cd django_market_api

# Activate the virtual environment
$ . ./venv/bin/activate

# Running the project
$ python manage.py runserver

# The application will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
